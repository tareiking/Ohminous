## OHMINOUS IPHONE APP:  Tarei King 2011, for BCT semester one
--------------------------------------------------------------

## A simple 4 band resistor calculator for iPhone
## has a little bit of extra "sex" with some real basic design hacks
## also comes with a free memory leak


OHMINOUS is a simple 4 band resistor calculator - so you always know how much resistance you require for your pet projects
and DIY goodness.

TODO:

---- Memory leak to be cleaned up
---- Add 5 band resistor calculator on rotate
---- Better functions and callbacks (very basic at the moment) for calculating resistance
---- Remove hackiness

WHAT TOOK AGES:

---- calculating with obj-c.  pow(x, y) is completely different to powf(x,y)
---- UIPickerView was has a few 'fun' bits "data delegates and view options" which took a bit of getting used to
